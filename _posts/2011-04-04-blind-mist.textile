p. Blind Mist is a project I worked on with "Brad Troemel":http://bradtroemel.com that debuted at 319 Scholes in "Read/Write":http://jstchillin.org, curated by JstChillin. 

p. Blind Mist provides a constantly revolving display of images organized at random. All images function as links to their place of origin and will eventually expire from public rotation. Anyone may add URLs to Blind Mist.
