p. Almost every day I find myself asking one question: "Is the L train fucked?"

p. The "L train":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L_(New_York_City_Subway_service) has a reputation for being a little less than reliable, especially during the summer. While it gets a lot of hate from New Yorkers, I don't think its *that* bad. At least its not the G train, amirite? Either way, since the L is really the only train that services my immediate neighborhood, I am naturally concerned about the status of the L train's service. 

p. Last night, while watching an episode of "Party Down":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_Down with my lovely roommate "Anna":http://www.annamackenzie.net, I put together "Is the L Train Fucked? (.com)":http://istheltrainfucked.com. The app is using the MTA's official API (which is great btw), Sinatra, Heroku, and GitHub. These awesome tools let people like me release fun apps so everyone mentinoed in the previous sentence: __great job!__
