p. "Dawn Metropolis":http://dawnmetropolis.com is an award winning series of animations to accompany each song in the debut LP from the chiptune all-stars, "Anamanaguchi":http://anamanaguchi.com. My role in the project was the lead animator. Using After Effects and Photoshop I compiled and animated the album in its entirety. This was truly a work of collaboration and could not have been possible without Dave Mauro, Paris Treantafeles and LOLZ LLC.
