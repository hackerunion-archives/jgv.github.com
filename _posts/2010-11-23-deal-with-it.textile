p. "Deal with this bookmarklet.":http://jonathanvingiano.com/deal-with-it

p. I made a quick little bookmarklet last night, inspired by Jeff Crouse's "Deal With It.app":http://www.jeffcrouse.info/bs/deal-with-it-app/. You can download it "here":http://jonathanvingiano.com/deal-with-it or get it by dragging the link below to your bookmark bar.

<a href="javascript:void((function(){var%20hsb=document.createElement('script');hsb.setAttribute('src','https://github.com/jgv/deal-with-it/raw/master/script.js');hsb.setAttribute('type','text/javascript');document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(hsb);})());">DEAL WITH IT</a>

p. In the future it would be awesome if I/someone added facedetection. So fork at will.
