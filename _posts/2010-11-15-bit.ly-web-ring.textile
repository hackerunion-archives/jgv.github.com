p. I made this with Jeff Garneau at the Bit.ly Hackabit in November 2010. The idea was concieved of with help from Bre Pettis of Makerbot. Surfing other peoples links is a really fun way to explore the web. So much fun that it got an "Honorable Mention from Bit.ly":http://blog.bit.ly/post/2071681766/announcing-the-winners-of-the-bit-ly-api-contest!
